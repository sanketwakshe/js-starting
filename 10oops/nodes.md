## 4 pillars
Abstraction =>Hide A Details(fetch)
Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.


Encapsulation=> data wrap 
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or object.


Inheritance=>Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).


Polymorphism=>manykam
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
It also allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the class they belong to (method overriding).
